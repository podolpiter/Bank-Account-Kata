# Bank-Account-Kata
A variation of the Bank Account Kata, but ignoring the prescribed rules. For those unfamiliar, the kata task is to develop a simple banking application with features such as deposits, withdrawals and printable statements. Rules are defined, which your code must conform to. I developed this one without applying the rules, so it could serve as a point of comparison, to see how the rules affected my coding style.
